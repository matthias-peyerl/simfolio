In addition to double inverse DAX performance, the index also contains interest payments resulting from the investment strategy in three times the amount of the overnight rate. Interest accrues in the same amount for the investment volume as well as for the funds received from short-selling. SHORTDAX X2 INDEX is therefore an attractive investment not only in falling but also in sideways markets and periods where market trends are unclear.Lyxor ETFs are efficient investment vehicles listed on exchange that offer transparent, liquid and low-cost exposure to the underlying benchmark index.;;;Lyxor International Asset Management;MIL;it_market

FLEQ.SW;Franklin LibertyQ European Equity UCITS ETF;EUR;The objective of the Sub-Fund is to provide exposure to large and mid-capitalisation stocks in Europe. In order to seek to achieve the Sub-Fund√¢¬Ä¬ôs investment objective, the Investment Manager will aim to replicate the Index by holding all of the Index Securities in a similar proportion to their weighting in the Index. However, where full replication of the Index is not reasonably possible (for example as a result of the number of securities or the illiquidity of certain securities within the Index), the Sub-Fund will use the optimisation methodology to select Index Securities in order to build a representative portfolio that provides a return that is comparable to that of the Index but which may not track the Index with the same degree of accuracy as an investment vehicle replicating the entire Index may. Consequently, the Sub-Fund may, over certain periods, only hold a sub-set of the Index Securities.;;;Franklink Templeton Investments;EBS;ch_market

SJPL is an exchange traded currency (""ETC""). Its securities can be created and redeemed on demand by authorised participants and traded on exchange just like shares in a company. The ETC obtains exposure to the Index by entering into unfunded swaps with a counterparty. There is no upfront cash payment by the Issuer to the counterparty when an unfunded swap is created. However, daily cash payments are made between the Issuer and the counterparty to reflect the daily movements in the value of the Index.";;;WisdomTree Asset Management;MIL;it_market

XBJQ is an exchange traded currency (""ETC""). Its securities can be created and redeemed on demand by authorised participants and traded on exchange just like shares in a company. The ETC obtains exposure to the Index by entering into unfunded swaps with a counterparty. There is no upfront cash payment by the Issuer to the counterparty when an unfunded swap is created. However, daily cash payments are made between the Issuer and the counterparty to reflect the daily movements in the value of the Index.";;;WisdomTree Asset Management;MIL;it_market
